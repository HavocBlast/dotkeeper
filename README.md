# Dotkeeper

## Introduction

After learning switching to mac and eventually linux I started to play around with dotfiles to make
the os look and behave in a way that I like. This process caused me to create different dotfiles to
try out different configurations and even distro hop until I settled for a more upstream distro.

## Purpose

With all the tinkering and changing environments I began spending an hour or so installing applications
and creating/cloning dotfiles everytime that I decided to change distro or reinstall linux to clean up
my system. This project is more of learning to program outside a learning platform like Boot.dev and to
gain some experience builing a project. Most of the features for this project could have been created
using a bash script but I am not learning bash so here it is in python. I will probably port this over to
C after I have moved from python as I continue my path to linux programming.
